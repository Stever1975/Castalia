<b>Closing <font color="#000080">something</font> </b><a name=Close></a> (<i>past tense</i> closed)<br>
<p>Closing makes something into
a physical barrier. The action can be performed on any kind of thing which
provides the either/or properties openable and open. The 'can't close unless
openable rule' tests to see if the noun both can be and actually is openable.
(It is assumed that anything which can be openable can also be open, and
hence can also be closed.) In the Standard Rules, the container and door
kinds both satisfy these requirements.<br><br>We can create a new kind on which opening and closing will work thus:
'A case file is a kind of thing. A case file can be openable.
A case file can be open. A case file is usually openable and closed.'<br><br>The meaning of open and closed is different for different kinds of thing.
When a container is closed, that means people outside cannot reach in,
and vice versa; when a door is closed, people cannot use the 'going' action
to pass through it. If we were to create a new kind such as 'case file',
we would also need to write rules to make the open and closed properties
interesting for this kind.<p><hr><p><b>Typed commands leading to this action</b><p>
