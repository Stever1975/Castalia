<b>Opening <font color="#000080">something</font> </b><a name=Open></a> (<i>past tense</i> opened)<br>
<p>Opening makes something no longer
a physical barrier. The action can be performed on any kind of thing which
provides the either/or properties openable and open. The 'can't open unless
openable rule' tests to see if the noun both can be and actually is openable.
(It is assumed that anything which can be openable can also be open.)
In the Standard Rules, the container and door kinds both satisfy these
requirements.<br><br>In the event that the thing to be opened is also lockable, we are forbidden
to open it when it is locked. Both containers and doors can be lockable,
but the opening and closing actions would also work fine with kinds which
cannot be.<br><br>We can create a new kind on which opening and closing will work thus:
'A case file is a kind of thing. A case file can be openable.
A case file can be open. A case file is usually openable and closed.'<br><br>The meaning of open and closed is different for different kinds of thing.
When a container is closed, that means people outside cannot reach in,
and vice versa; when a door is closed, people cannot use the 'going' action
to pass through it. If we were to create a new kind such as 'case file',
we would also need to write rules to make the open and closed properties
interesting for this kind.<p><hr><p><b>Typed commands leading to this action</b><p>
