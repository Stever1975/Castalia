<p>The Standard Rules do
not include any systematic way to handle conversation: instead, Inform is
set up so that it is as easy as we can make it to write specific rules
handling speech in particular games, and so that if no such rules are
written then all attempts to communicate are gracefully if not very
interestingly rejected.<br><br>The topic here can be any double-quoted text, which can itself contain
tokens in square brackets: see the documentation on Understanding.<br><br>Answering is an action existing so that the player can say something free-form
to somebody else. A convention of IF is that a command such as DAPHNE, TAKE
MASK is a request to Daphne to perform an action: if the persuasion rules in
force mean that she consents, the action 'Daphne taking the mask' does
indeed then result. But if the player types DAPHNE, 12375 or DAPHNE, GREAT
HEAVENS - or anything else not making sense as a command - the action
'answering Daphne that ...' will be generated.<br><br>The name of the action arises because it is also caused by typing, say,
ANSWER 12375 when Daphne (say) has asked a question.<p><hr><p><b>Typed commands leading to this action</b><p>
